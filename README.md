# Movie rental manager
A program to manage a movie database, with rentals per user.
Features:
- Create an account with different privileges
- Very basic permission system, the permissions are preset and depend on the chosen account type
- User login
- Password change
- Set a profile picture
- Delete account
- Add/Delete movies to/from database
- Edit movie details
- Mark a movie as rented, as well as keeping track of when it was rented and the time limit
- State machine diagram included (not really a program feature but hey...)

Updates coming *never*.  
The program is in romanian, no other translation is planned.  
Make sure the database location is set correctly in the connection string located in Form2 before compiling, otherwise the program will not function correctly (it is this way because no graphical database picker is implemented).  
Make sure your database has the same structure as the sample Access database included.
